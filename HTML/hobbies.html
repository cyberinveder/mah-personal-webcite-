     <h3>books</h3> <br>
     my favorite hobby of them all is reading books. as a kid, we all know that we adore video games and hate books, but that was not my case. from early childhood (about 4 or so years old) <br>
     i was reading books like a maniac. or, you know, <strong>3 mini books a day?</strong> that might not sound much, but when you have just learned how to read, i would say that is great acomplishment. <br>
     as a teenager, i would invest majority of my day in reading my favorite books. some of them come from classic fantasy writers, some come from more modern fantasy writers, some come from adventure books- you name it! <br>
     at this point of my life (15 years old), i have alreaddy exhausted my family book collection (which has probably more than 200 books in total), which is good- i can now focus on school much more better.

     <h3>video Games</h3> <br>
     video games are my second (and now most) favorite hobby. what can i say- i play lots of games. shooters, strategies, puzzles, survivals- any of these except horrors. yea, i hate that genre. <br>
     recently, we have bought a VR (virtual reality) hedset called Ocolus Quest 2. it is <strong>Amazing!</strong> i am playing pavlov shack- VR equivalent to counter strike- and i am loving its interactions so much! <br>
     for real, you can even play russian rulet in that game! many gamemodes, great interaction with people- i love it!

     <h3>math</h3> <br>
     welp- there is not much to be said here. i love math- which means i love making hard problems in geometry and planeometry, but totally hate arithmatics which involve many calculations, as i get mistakes much often. <br>
